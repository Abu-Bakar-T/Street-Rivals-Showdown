## Reflection

- We should have properly planned the project (along with project timeline) from the beginning.  
- The game should have been designed before starting development.  
- We should have limited the features to prevent the feature creep that occurred.  
- The core mechanics should have been outlined more clearly.  
- The design should have been tailored to support the development process.  
- We should have spent more time refining the core mechanics to avoid confusion during development.
